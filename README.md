## Jellyfish Town
Jellyfish Town is a text adventure game where the player controls a scuba diver exploring the ocean. They must complete 3 "trials" to "win" the game, including Hide and Seek, Trivia, and Build a Mud-Man.

An issue I faced with Jellyfish Town was the player being able to just complete the same trial 3 times to win, but this was solved by adding completely seperate point counters to each trial, so that when each reaches 1, the player can continue.
